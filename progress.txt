I started this project.
Day 1:
    I built a simple structure of the project.
        Learning:
            I learned about pathlib which is used to replace old file path handling.
            Old path handling was like path = 'path as string.' which contains too many //,
            breaks, messy and harder to read and manage.
            Modern way is pathlib which is cleaner, crossplatform, industry standard in
            industry standard automation scripts.
        
        About pathlib:
            from pathlib import path
            Path is a class that represents a file or folder location.
            Example:
                p = Path("myfile.txt")
            Now p is not a string. It is a Path object with special abilities.

        Key Concepts I used today:
            1. Path.home()
            This gives your user home directory:
            Windows: C:\Users\YourName
            So,                         downloads = Path.home() / "Downloads"
            Automatically becomes:      C:\Users\YourName\Downloads

            2. The / Operator in Pathlib
            This looks weird at first:
                Path.home() / "Downloads"
            But it means: Join paths safely
            Instead of doing:
                str(Path.home()) + "\\Downloads"
            Pathlib does it correctly.

            3. .iterdir()
                downloads_folder.iterdir()
            Means:
            Iterate through all items inside the folder
            Example:
            for file in downloads_folder.iterdir():
                print(file)
            Output could be:
                css
                Copy code
                resume.pdf
                photo.png
                video.mp4
            
            4. .name
            Each file is also a Path object. So:
                file.name
            Gives only the file name:
            resume.pdf

Day 2:
        Key Concepts I used today:
            5. .suffix
            Very important for organizing files:
                file.suffix
            Example:
            "resume.pdf" → .pdf
            "photo.png" → .png

            6. .exists()
            Check if a file/folder exists:
                folder.exists()
            Returns:
            True/False

            7. .mkdir()
            Create a folder:
                Path("PDFs").mkdir()
            Or safely:
                Path("PDFs").mkdir(exist_ok=True)
            So it won’t crash if folder already exists.

            8. .rename() or .replace()
            Move files:
                file.replace(new_location)
            Example:
                file.replace(downloads_folder / "PDFs" / file.name)
            Moves the file.
